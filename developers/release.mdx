## 1. Finalize code changes

- Keep features and docs in the same release branch.
- Confirm no unresolved TODO items remain for launch-critical behavior.

## 2. Run release validations

```bash
pnpm run build
cd src-tauri && cargo test
```

If documentation changed:

```bash
cd rainy-docs
mint broken-links
mint validate
```

## 3. Verify release metadata

Check and align version values before tagging:

- `package.json`
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

## 4. Build desktop artifacts

```bash
pnpm run tauri build
```

## 5. Publish and communicate

- Publish the GitHub release artifacts.
- Update release notes with behavior changes and migration impact.
- Confirm docs on Mintlify reflect the same release version.
