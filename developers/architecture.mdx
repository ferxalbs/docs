description: Understand Rainy MaTE runtime boundaries between React UI, Tauri bridge, and Rust services.

## Runtime layers

Rainy MaTE is split into clear layers:

- `src/`: React + TypeScript desktop UI.
- `src-tauri/src/`: Rust command handlers and services.
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`: packaging, updater, and app runtime config.

## Design rule

Keep heavy logic in Rust services and commands. Keep TypeScript focused on UI orchestration.

## Core capability surfaces

- `Agent Chat`: workspace prompt execution.
- `Agent Builder`: agent spec authoring and policy setup.
- `Agent Store`: review and deploy saved specs.
- `Rainy ATM (Neural panel)`: cloud connection and activity stream.

## Theme system

- Default app theme: `rainy-tahoe`.
- Theme definitions: `src/lib/themes.ts`.
- Base tokens: `src/global.css`.

Continue with `/components/design-system` for Tahoe documentation colors and surfaces.

## Security boundary

Cloud-originated commands are checked by Airlock before execution.

- Airlock implementation: `src-tauri/src/services/airlock.rs`
- Tool execution: `src-tauri/src/services/skill_executor.rs`

Use `/reference/airlock-security` for approval behavior details.
