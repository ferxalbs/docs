## Rust test suite

Run backend tests from the Tauri crate:

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo test
```

## Frontend quality checks

The repository currently provides build verification through TypeScript + Vite:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

## Docs checks

From `rainy-docs`, run Mintlify validation commands:

```bash
mint broken-links
mint validate
```

## Release readiness checklist

- Tests pass in `src-tauri`.
- Frontend build passes at repo root.
- Docs links and structure validate in `rainy-docs`.
- Security-sensitive docs reflect current Airlock behavior.
