## Scope

This guide is for developers who want to:

- Design production agent profiles.
- Add new executable tools to the desktop runtime.
- Keep Airlock and policy behavior safe by default.

## Build an agent profile

Use `Agent Builder` in the app for normal profile creation, then validate with test prompts in `Agent Chat`.

Recommended sequence:

1. Define narrow role and expected outputs in `Soul`.
2. Enable only required tool categories in `Skills`.
3. Keep memory scope minimal in early versions.
4. Set strict Airlock defaults.
5. Validate with representative prompts before deploying.

## Add a new local tool (Rust)

Implement tools in `src-tauri/src/services/skill_executor.rs`.

1. Add the tool argument schema struct.
2. Add the tool definition in `get_tool_definitions()`.
3. Add method routing in `execute()`.
4. Implement handler logic (for example `handle_new_skill`).
5. Assign correct Airlock level and policy behavior.
6. Add tests in Rust for allowed/blocked behavior.

## Expose tool behavior to UI

Update relevant UI defaults and docs so users can understand and safely use the new capability.

Common places:

- `src/components/neural/*`
- `src/services/tauri.ts`
- `rainy-docs/reference/skills-reference.mdx`

## Security requirements

- Avoid broad filesystem or shell access by default.
- Keep dangerous operations explicitly gated.
- Document any new destructive path in `/reference/airlock-security`.
