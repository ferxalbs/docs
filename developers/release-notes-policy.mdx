description: Simple policy for writing clear release notes as Rainy MaTE evolves.

## Why this exists

Rainy MaTE is a living project. Features will change, improve, or be replaced over time.

Release notes keep everyone aligned without extra ceremony.

## Tone and style

- Write for humans, not marketing.
- Keep notes short and concrete.
- Describe what changed and what users should do.

## Required sections per release

1. `Added`
2. `Changed`
3. `Fixed`
4. `Breaking or behavior changes`
5. `Upgrade notes`

## What each section should contain

### Added

- New capabilities users can try now.

### Changed

- Workflow, UI, or defaults that behave differently.

### Fixed

- Bugs with visible impact and how they are resolved.

### Breaking or behavior changes

- Anything that can break scripts, habits, or team workflows.
- Include migration steps when needed.

### Upgrade notes

- Platform notes (`macOS only` in BETA 1).
- Security/signing notes if relevant.
- Required actions after updating.

## Minimum quality bar

- Every item includes impact and scope.
- Avoid vague text like "improvements" without detail.
- Link to docs pages when behavior changed.

## Example template

```md
## Added
- New tool policy audit view in Rainy ATM activity section.

## Changed

## Fixed
