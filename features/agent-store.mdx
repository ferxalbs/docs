## What it does

`Agent Store` is the management surface for saved agents. Use it to inspect specs, update fields, and deploy existing agents without rebuilding from scratch.

## Core actions

- Search saved agents by name or description.
- Open a selected agent in review/edit mode.
- Save updates to local specs.
- Deploy a selected spec to Rainy ATM.
- Open selected spec in `Agent Builder` for full editing.

## Deployment behavior

Deployment requires valid Rainy ATM credentials. If credentials are missing, deployment is blocked until the Cloud connection is configured.

## Recommended workflow

1. Keep draft iteration in `Agent Builder`.
2. Use `Agent Store` for review and controlled updates.
3. Deploy only tested specs to keep cloud agents stable.
