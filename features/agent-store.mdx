## Purpose

`Agent Store` is the inventory view for agent profiles already saved in your environment.

## What you can do

- Search agents by name or description.
- Inspect profile details before use.
- Edit and save profile changes.
- Deploy a selected profile to Rainy ATM.
- Open a profile in Agent Builder for deeper edits.

## Recommended team workflow

1. Build and test draft agents in `Agent Builder`.
2. Promote stable profiles into `Agent Store`.
3. Use store reviews before each deployment.
4. Keep a small set of approved production agents.

## Deployment requirements

Deployment from Agent Store requires active Rainy ATM credentials and connectivity.
