## Execution loop

Rainy MaTE executes tasks in a plan-and-act loop:

1. Parse your goal into actionable steps.
2. Select tools per step.
3. Run tools with Airlock checks.
4. Stream progress and outputs.
5. Continue until completion or user interruption.

## Airlock levels

Rainy MaTE classifies tools into three levels.

| Level | Meaning | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `0` | Safe read-only | `read_file`, `list_files`, `search_files`, `web_search`, `read_web_page`, `screenshot`, `get_page_content` |
| `1` | Sensitive state-changing | `write_file`, `append_file`, `mkdir`, `browse_url`, `click_element`, `navigate` |
| `2` | Dangerous/destructive | `execute_command`, `delete_file`, `move_file` |

## Why this matters

- You can allow autonomous progress for low-risk steps.
- You can keep explicit human approval on destructive actions.
- You can audit command execution from `Rainy ATM > Activity`.

<Warning>
  Keep `Level 2` operations gated in production workflows unless you fully trust
  the task and the current workspace scope.
