## Overview

**Autonomous Workflows** allow Rainy MaTE to execute multi-step objectives without constant human supervision. By chaining together research, planning, execution, and verification steps, the AI can handle complex projects from start to finish.

## How It Works

1.  **Trigger**: You provide a high-level goal (e.g., "Refactor the authentication system").
2.  **Plan**: Rainy MaTE analyzes the request and creates a detailed [Implementation Plan](/components/usage-guidelines).
3.  **Act**: The AI executes the plan, step-by-step, using its available tools.
4.  **Verify**: After each step, the AI verifies the output to ensure correctness.
5.  **Loop**: The cycle continues until the goal is achieved.

## Examples

### Code Refactoring

Rainy MaTE can explore a codebase, identify legacy patterns, and apply modern best practices across multiple files.

### Research & Report

Ask Rainy MaTE to research a topic, gather data from multiple sources, and compile a comprehensive report with citations.

### Deployment

Automate your deployment pipeline by letting Rainy MaTE handle build, test, and release processes.

## Safety & Control

You remain in control at all times.

- **Review Mode**: Require approval before critical actions (e.g., deleting files, deployment).
- **Stop Button**: Instantly halt any workflow with a single click.
- **Audit Logs**: Review a detailed log of every action taken by the AI.
