## Execution model

Rainy MaTE follows a plan-and-act loop:

1. Interpret your goal.
2. Break into executable steps.
3. Select tools per step.
4. Run steps with Airlock checks.
5. Stream progress and continue until done or interrupted.

## Why this matters

This model lets you keep fast automation while preserving control over risky operations.

## Airlock levels in workflows

| Level | Meaning | Typical tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Safe` | Read-only operations | `read_file`, `list_files`, `web_search`, `read_web_page`, `screenshot` |
| `Sensitive` | State-changing operations | `write_file`, `mkdir`, `browse_url`, `click_element` |
| `Dangerous` | Destructive or command execution | `execute_command`, `delete_file`, `move_file` |

## Operational recommendations

- Keep `Dangerous` actions manually approved in production.
- Start with narrow prompts and expand after success.
- Use activity logs in Rainy ATM to audit execution behavior.

<Warning>
  Do not run broad destructive requests without explicit scope and approval.
