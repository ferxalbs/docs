## Overview

The **Neural Panel** is the primary interface for interacting with Rainy MaTE's cognitive functions. It visualizes the state of active agents, displays real-time thought processes, and allows for direct intervention and guidance.

Designed with our **Tahoe** theme, the Neural Panel offers a clean, distraction-free environment that adapts to your workflow.

## Interface Components

### 1. Active Agents Grid

See all your currently running agents at a glance. Each card displays:

- **Agent Name**: The identity of the agent.
- **Current Task**: What the agent is working on right now.
- **Status Indicator**: Visual cue for status (Idle, Thinking, Executing, Error).

### 2. Live Thought Stream

Watch Rainy MaTE think in real-time. The thought stream reveals the decision-making process, showing you exactly how the AI breaks down complex problems into actionable steps.

### 3. Command Input

Directly issue commands to your agents. The context-aware input suggests relevant actions based on the current state of your workspace.

## Usage

### Monitoring Agents

Simply open the Neural Panel to see an overview of all system activity. The panel updates in real-time, providing instant feedback on agent performance.

### Intervening

If an agent needs guidance, you can pause its execution directly from the panel and provide new instructions or correct its course.

<Note>
  The Neural Panel is designed to be always-on but unobtrusive. You can toggle
  its visibility with a global hotkey (default: `Cmd + .`).
