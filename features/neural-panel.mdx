## What it does

The `Rainy ATM` section connects your desktop app to Cloud Cortex and exposes operational controls for remote workflows.

If not connected, the panel asks for:

- `Platform key`
- `User API key`
- Optional `Workspace name`

After connection, the panel provides three tabs.

## Dashboard

- Shows active workspace name and ID.
- Provides a direct link to Cloud Cortex.
- Generates a temporary session code for Telegram pairing.

## Agents

- Lists active deployed agents.
- Lets you jump directly into `Agent Builder` for deployment.

## Activity

- Shows recent command history.
- Displays per-command status, telemetry, and progress events.
- Helps diagnose queue delay, run duration, and total duration.

<Note>
  Use this view as your operational audit surface for cloud-executed workflows.
