## Builder sections

Agent Builder is split into four editing areas:

- `Soul`: role, purpose, and execution style.
- `Skills`: tool capabilities available to the agent.
- `Memory`: context retention behavior.
- `Airlock`: risk and approval policy.

## Safe first deployment flow

1. Define a narrow role in `Soul`.
2. Enable only required tools in `Skills`.
3. Keep memory minimal for first iteration.
4. Set restrictive Airlock defaults.
5. Save and test in `Agent Chat`.
6. Deploy after behavior review.

## Save and deploy behavior

- `Save Draft`: persists locally.
- `Deploy`: publishes to Rainy ATM.

Deployment requires a valid Rainy ATM connection.

## Common mistakes

- Defining broad roles that trigger uncontrolled tool use.
- Allowing command execution too early.
- Deploying without running local test prompts first.
