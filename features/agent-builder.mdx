## Builder sections

`Agent Builder` has four editing tabs:

- `Soul`: identity, role, and high-level behavior.
- `Skills`: capabilities the agent can use.
- `Memory`: retention and retrieval configuration.
- `Airlock`: permission policy and tool-level controls.

## Save and deploy

- `Save Draft` stores the agent spec locally.
- `Deploy` publishes the spec to Rainy ATM.

Deployment requires valid ATM credentials loaded in the app.

## Recommended production flow

1. Start with a narrow role and clear boundaries in `Soul`.
2. Add only required skills.
3. Keep memory scope minimal at first.
4. Set restrictive Airlock defaults.
5. Test in `Agent Chat` before cloud deployment.

## Common pitfalls

- Over-broad skills on first version.
- Missing Airlock constraints for shell and destructive filesystem tools.
- Deploying without validating behavior in a controlled workspace.
