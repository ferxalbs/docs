## Overview

The **Agent Builder** allows you to extend Rainy MaTE's capabilities by creating custom agents. Whether you need a coding assistant, a data analyst, or a creative writer, the Agent Builder provides the tools to bring them to life.

## Creating a New Agent

1.  **Navigate to Agent Builder**: clearSelect "Agent Builder" from the main menu.
2.  **Define Core Identity**: Give your agent a name, a role, and a description. This helps shape its personality and approach to tasks.
3.  **Select Skills**: Choose from the library of available skills. Skills are modular capabilities that define what your agent can do (e.g., `code-analysis`, `web-search`, `image-generation`).
4.  **Set Scope**: Define the boundaries of your agent's operation. Limit access to specific directories or file types for security.

## Configuration Options

### Personality

Adjust parameters like creativity, precision, and tone.

- **Creativity**: How novel should the agent's solutions be?
- **Precision**: How strictly should it adhere to instructions?

### Resource Allocation

Allocate system resources to your agent. High-performance agents may require more memory and processing power.

## Managing Agents

Once created, agents appear in your **Agent Store**. From here you can:

- **Activate/Deactivate**: Turn agents on or off as needed.
- **Edit**: Update an agent's configuration as your needs change.
- **Share**: Export your agent configurations to share with the community.

<Tip>
  Start with a predefined template to quickly create common agent types like
  "Senior Developer" or "Technical Writer".
