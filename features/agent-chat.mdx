## What it does

`Agent Chat` is the default operating surface for Rainy MaTE. It runs prompts against the currently selected workspace folder and uses the selected model and agent spec.

## Top controls

- `Agent selector`: pick which saved agent spec to run.
- `Model selector`: pick the active model.
- `Theme toggle`: switch light or dark mode quickly.
- `Clear UI`: clears visible chat messages.
- `Delete context (memory)`: clears persisted chat context for the active workspace.

## Prompt workflow

1. Select workspace folder.
2. Select agent and model.
3. Send a prompt.
4. Review generated plan steps.
5. Approve or reject actions that require Airlock confirmation.

<Note>
  Press `Enter` to send. Use `Shift + Enter` for a newline in the input box.
</Note>

## Behavior to expect

- The panel shows planning and execution phases.
- Model selection persists through app commands.
- Chat uses workspace-scoped context, so folder selection matters for outcomes.
