## Prompt design

- Keep prompts short and explicit.
- Break large tasks into small commands.
- Prefer follow-up refinement over one oversized instruction.

## Operational discipline

- Use `/agent current` before critical tasks.
- Use `/node status` when responses are delayed.
- Keep one workspace objective per chat thread to reduce context drift.

## Security

- Do not share pairing codes.
- Revoke sessions when team membership changes.
- Keep destructive actions gated behind Airlock confirmation in the desktop app.

## Reliability

- `/browse` tasks can run longer than normal chat prompts.
- When a task fails, retry with narrower scope.
- Use Rainy ATM `Activity` to inspect queue and execution timing.
