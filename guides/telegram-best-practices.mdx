## Prompt discipline

- Keep prompts short and specific.
- Execute one objective per command.
- Ask for plans before broad file modifications.

## Operational discipline

- Run `/agent current` before critical prompts.
- Run `/node status` when response latency increases.
- Keep one workspace objective per chat thread.

## Security controls

- Never share session codes.
- Rotate pairing by reconnecting if team access changes.
- Keep dangerous actions behind explicit Airlock approvals.

## Failure handling

- Retry with narrower scope when a run fails.
- Inspect desktop Rainy ATM Activity for root cause.
- Escalate persistent failures to desktop-side troubleshooting.
