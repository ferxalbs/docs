## Designing for Chat

Telegram is a chat interface, and your agents should be designed with that in mind.

### 1. Conciseness is Key

Mobile screens have limited space.

- **Do**: Instruct your agents to be brief and direct.
- **Don't**: Send wall-of-text responses unless specifically asked for a report.

### 2. Use formatting wisely

Rainy MaTE automatically converts standard Markdown to Telegram-compatible formatting.

- Use **bold** for emphasis.
- Use `code blocks` for technical data or IDs.
- Use lists to break down complex information.

## Security

### Webhook Secrets

Always configure a `Webhook Secret` in both Telegram and Rainy MaTE. This strictly ensures that only updates from Telegram are processed by your agent runtime, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks or spoofed messages.

### Access Control

Rainy MaTE uses a zero-trust pairing model.

- Never share your pairing codes.
- Regularly audit active sessions in the **Neural Panel**.
- If a device is lost, revoke its access immediately from the desktop app.

## Performance

### Timeouts

The default timeout for an agent response is **4 minutes**.

- For complex research tasks (`/browse`), the agent might take longer.
- **Best Practice**: Break down massive tasks into smaller, interactive steps. Instead of "Research the history of computing," try "Find the key events in 1990s computing."

## Media Handling

Rainy MaTE supports multi-modal interactions.

- **Voice Notes**: You can speak to your agent. Ensure you speak clearly.
- **Images**: Agents can analyze images. Send a photo and ask "What is in this image?" or "Extract the text from this screenshot."
