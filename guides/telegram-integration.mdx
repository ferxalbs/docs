- Access to Telegram.
- A running workspace with at least one deployed agent.

## Pair a chat

1. Open `Rainy ATM` in the desktop app.
2. In `Dashboard`, click `Generate Session Code`.
3. Open [@RainyAMTBot](https://t.me/RainyAMTBot) in Telegram.
4. Send the code in chat.
5. Wait for `Pairing Successful` confirmation.

## Core commands

| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/help` | Show command help |
| `/ask <prompt>` | Send a prompt to the active agent |
| `/browse <url>` | Queue a browse-and-summarize workflow |
| `/agent list` | List deployed agents |
| `/agent current` | Show selected agent |
| `/agent use [id-or-name]` | Switch active agent for this chat |

## Security notes
