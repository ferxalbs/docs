## Overview

Rainy MaTE's Telegram integration allows you to interact with your agents, manage tasks, and receiving notifications directly from your favorite messaging app. It is built on a custom, high-performance connector that requires no external libraries.

## Features

- **Full Agent Access**: Chat with any of your deployed agents.
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Send text, voice notes, photos, and files.
- **Inline Controls**: Manage your session with interactive buttons.
- **Secure Pairing**: Zero-trust linkage between your Telegram account and Rainy MaTE workspace.

## Setup

### 1. Create a Bot

1.  Open Telegram and chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2.  Send `/newbot` and follow the instructions to create a new bot.
3.  Copy the **HTTP API Token** provided.

### 2. Configure Rainy MaTE

1.  Open the **Neural Panel** settings.
2.  Navigate to **Integrations > Telegram**.
3.  Paste your Bot Token.
4.  (Optional) Set a `Webhook Secret` for enhanced security.

## Commands

| Command           | Description                                         |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `/ask <prompt>`   | Send a specific prompt to the active agent.         |
| `/browse <url>`   | Instruct the agent to browse and analyze a website. |
| `/agent list`     | Show all available agents.                          |
| `/agent use <id>` | Switch to a different agent.                        |
| `/agent clear`    | Reset session to default agent.                     |

## Interactive Controls

Every session message includes a control panel:

- **📊 Status**: Check connection health and active workspace.
- **🤖 Agents**: Quick-switch menu for selecting agents.
- **🚪 Logout**: Securely disconnect your Telegram account.

## Architecture

The integration follows a secure, event-driven architecture:

1.  **Webhook**: Telegram sends an update to your Rainy MaTE instance.
2.  **Verification**: The request signature is verified against your secret.
3.  **Normalization**: The message is converted to a standard internal format.
4.  **Deduplication**: Unique event IDs prevent duplicate processing.
5.  **Queue**: The message is queued for the Agent Runtime.
6.  **Resolution**: The agent processes the input and sends a response back via the Telegram API.

<Note>
  Rainy MaTE uses a pure `fetch` implementation for the Telegram API to ensure
  maximum performance and minimal dependencies.
