## Use case

Telegram lets operators send prompts and run remote workflows when away from the desktop UI.

## Prerequisites

- Desktop app connected in `Rainy ATM`.
- At least one deployed agent.
- Access to Telegram.

## Pairing flow

1. Open `Rainy ATM -> Dashboard`.
2. Generate a session code.
3. Open [@RainyAMTBot](https://t.me/RainyAMTBot).
4. Send the session code.
5. Wait for pairing confirmation.

## Common commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/ask <prompt>` | Send prompt to active agent |
| `/browse <url>` | Queue browse-and-summarize task |
| `/agent list` | List deployed agents |
| `/agent current` | Show active agent |
| `/agent use [id-or-name]` | Switch active agent |
| `/agent clear` | Reset to workspace default |
| `/node status` | Check desktop node status |

## Security behavior

- Pairing codes are temporary.
- Tool runs still go through Airlock policy.
- You can revoke access by disconnecting the workspace from desktop Rainy ATM.

Read `/guides/telegram-best-practices` before enabling this in production operations.
