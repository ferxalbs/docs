## Overview

Airlock is the command firewall between cloud-queued tasks and local execution.

Implementation source:

- `src-tauri/src/services/airlock.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/services/skill_executor.rs`

## Airlock levels

| Level | Name | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `0` | Safe | Auto-approved read operations |
| `1` | Sensitive | Requires approval flow (notification) |
| `2` | Dangerous | Requires explicit approval |

## Timeout behavior

- Sensitive requests time out after `10` seconds.
- Dangerous requests time out after `30` seconds.
- Timeout defaults to deny.

## Headless mode behavior

- Safe: always auto-approved.
- Sensitive: can auto-approve in headless mode.
- Dangerous: never bypassed by headless mode.

## Tool risk examples

- Safe: `read_file`, `list_files`, `search_files`, `web_search`, `read_web_page`, `screenshot`
- Sensitive: `write_file`, `mkdir`, `browse_url`, `click_element`
- Dangerous: `execute_command`, `delete_file`, `move_file`

<Warning>
  Keep dangerous commands behind explicit approval in production workspaces.
</Warning>
