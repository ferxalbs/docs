## Layout and readability

- Keep hierarchy shallow and predictable.
- Use clear section titles and short procedural blocks.
- Place prerequisites before action steps.

## Color behavior

- Use Tahoe blue for primary intent and navigation emphasis.
- Reserve green for success, yellow for warning, red for error.
- Keep neutral surfaces low contrast to let status colors stand out.

## Surfaces

- Use translucent cards with blur for layered panels.
- Avoid fully opaque heavy blocks in execution-heavy screens.
- Keep borders subtle but visible in both light and dark modes.

## Motion

- Use short transitions for state changes.
- Avoid decorative animation in operational workflows.

## Accessibility baseline

- Maintain readable contrast in light and dark modes.
- Keep keyboard focus visible on actionable elements.
- Label destructive and security-sensitive actions explicitly.

## Engineering alignment

- Keep business logic in Rust (`src-tauri/src`).
- Keep TypeScript focused on UI behavior and state.
- Remove dead code and stale docs references before release.
