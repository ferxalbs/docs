## Layout and surfaces

- Keep hierarchy shallow and scannable.
- Use translucent card surfaces with blur for layered UI.
- Avoid introducing visual styles that conflict with Tahoe blue tokens.

## Color semantics

- `Blue`: primary actions and informational state.
- `Green`: success and healthy status.
- `Yellow`: warning or pending state.
- `Red`: errors and destructive actions.

## Motion

- Keep transitions short and functional.
- Use motion to clarify state changes, not for decoration.

## Accessibility baseline

- Maintain readable contrast in both light and dark mode.
- Ensure keyboard access for actionable controls.
- Keep labels explicit on security-sensitive actions.

## Engineering constraints

- Keep heavy logic in Rust services and commands.
- Keep TypeScript primarily as UI orchestration.
- Avoid dead code and stale documentation references.
