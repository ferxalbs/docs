## Design Principles

When building interfaces or extensions for Rainy MaTE, strictly adhere to the following principles:

### 1. Liquid Glass

Use `backdrop-blur-md` and semi-transparent backgrounds (`bg-white/10` or `bg-black/10`) for all overlay elements. This maintains context and depth.

### 2. Semantic Colors

Use widely recognized semantic colors for status indicators:

- <span className="text-blue-500">Blue</span>: Primary action / Info
- <span className="text-green-500">Green</span>: Success / Active
- <span className="text-yellow-500">Yellow</span>: Warning / Pending
- <span className="text-red-500">Red</span>: Error / Destructive

### 3. Motion

Use motion to enhance understanding, not to distract. Transitions should be around `200ms` and use an `ease-out` curve.

## Accessibility

- **Contrast**: Ensure text has sufficient contrast against its background.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements must be focusable and usable via keyboard.
- **Screen Readers**: Use semantic HTML and aria-labels where appropriate.

## Code Style

Follow the project's Typescript and React standards:

- Use functional components with hooks.
- Type strictly; avoid `any`.
- Use `tailwind-merge` for class name composition.

## Do's and Don'ts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do" icon="check" color="green">
    - Use the provided HeroUI components. - Follow the color palette strictly. -
    Test for accessibility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don't" icon="xmark" color="red">
    - Use custom CSS when Tailwind utility classes suffice. - Introduce new
    fonts. - Create inconsistent UI patterns.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
