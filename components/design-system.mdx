## Overview

Rainy MaTE utilizes the **Tahoe** design system, a custom visual language inspired by the serene blues and clean lines of Lake Tahoe. It emphasizes clarity, focus, and a premium aesthetic.

## Core Principles

### 1. Liquid Glass Aesthetics

The interface makes heavy use of backdrop blurs and semi-transparent gradients to create a sense of depth and fluidity. This "liquid glass" effect is a signature of the Rainy MaTE experience.

### 2. Focus on Content

Design elements are intentionally minimal, allowing the user's content and the AI's thoughts to take center stage. We use whitespace generously to prevent cognitive overload.

### 3. Motion with Meaning

Animations are used not just for decoration, but to guide the user's attention and provide feedback on system status. Transitions are smooth and natural, mimicking organic movement.

## Color Palette

Our primary palette is rooted in deep, calming blues and vibrant accents.

| Color            | Value     | Usage                                         |
| :--------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Blue** | `#2563EB` | Main actions, primary buttons, active states. |
| **Light Accent** | `#60A5FA` | Hover states, secondary highlights.           |
| **Dark Accent**  | `#1E40AF` | Background gradients, deep shadows.           |
| **Surface**      | `#0F172A` | Main background color in dark mode.           |

## Typography

We use **Inter** for its excellent legibility and modern character. Headers are bold and expressive, while body text is clean and easy to read.

## Components

Rainy MaTE is built using **HeroUI v3**, ensuring accessibility and performance. We have customized the default HeroUI theme to match our Tahoe aesthetic.

### Buttons

Buttons feature a subtle gradient and a soft shadow that deepens on hover.

```jsx
<Button variant="primary">Launch Agent</Button>
```

### Cards

Cards use the "liquid glass" effect, with a subtle border and a blurred background.

```jsx
<Card className="backdrop-blur-md bg-white/10 border-white/20">
  <Card.Header>
    <Card.Title>Agent Status</Card.Title>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Content>Online</Card.Content>
</Card>
```
