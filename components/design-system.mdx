## Overview

`Rainy Tahoe` is the default product theme. It uses cool blue accents, translucent surfaces, and soft contrast to keep execution-heavy screens readable for long sessions.

## Core palette

The Mintlify docs site mirrors the Tahoe blue system used by the app:

- `Primary`: `#2563EB`
- `Light accent`: `#60A5FA`
- `Dark accent`: `#1E40AF`
- `Light background`: `#F8FAFF`
- `Dark background`: `#0B1220`

## Product token reference

The desktop app stores Tahoe theme tokens in `src/lib/themes.ts` under `rainy-tahoe`.

- Light primary token: `oklch(0.55 0.22 255)`
- Dark primary token: `oklch(0.65 0.2 255)`

## Surface style

Use layered translucent surfaces for modal and card UI:

```tsx
<div className="backdrop-blur-md bg-white/10 border-white/20" />
```

This pattern is required for overlays, modals, and cards in Rainy UI standards.
