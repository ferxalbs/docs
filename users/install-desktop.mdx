## Supported deployment model

Rainy MaTE is distributed as a desktop app. The current documented release baseline is `0.5.19`.

## Install from GitHub releases

1. Open [Rainy MaTE Releases](https://github.com/ferxalbs/rainy-cowork/releases).
2. Download the latest package for your OS.
3. Install and launch the app.

## First launch checklist

- Confirm the app opens without update errors.
- Add at least one workspace folder.
- Configure and validate one provider key.
- Run a simple task in `Agent Chat`.

## Update strategy for production teams

- Keep all operator desktops on the same release tag.
- Apply updates in a staging workspace first.
- Roll out to production users after successful validation.

<Warning>
  Avoid mixing old and new desktop versions in the same operations team when using shared Rainy ATM workflows.
</Warning>

## Build from source (advanced)

Use source builds only if you need custom code changes.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

For release builds:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

Continue with `/users/first-workflow` after install.
