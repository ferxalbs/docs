2. Open `System Settings -> Privacy & Security`.
3. In the security section, find the blocked app message and click `Open Anyway`.
4. Confirm by clicking `Open` in the follow-up dialog.
5. Launch Rainy MaTE again.

## First launch checklist

- Confirm the app opens without update errors.
- Add at least one workspace folder.
- Configure and validate one provider key.
- Run a simple task in `Agent Chat`.

## Update strategy for production teams

- Keep all operator desktops on the same release tag.
- Apply updates in a staging workspace first.
- Roll out to production users after validation.

Continue with `/users/first-workflow` after install.
