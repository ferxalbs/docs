## Goal

Finish one end-to-end task with approvals, outputs, and activity visibility.

## Step 1: set a workspace

1. Click `Add Folder` in the sidebar.
2. Select a folder that can be safely modified.
3. Confirm it appears as the active workspace.

## Step 2: select model and agent

1. Open `Agent Chat`.
2. Choose an agent profile.
3. Choose a model from the selector.

## Step 3: run a scoped prompt

Start with a bounded request:

```text
Create a 5-step plan to improve README clarity in this repository. Do not edit files until approved.
```

## Step 4: handle Airlock approvals

- `Safe` actions proceed automatically.
- `Sensitive` actions require notification and approval flow.
- `Dangerous` actions require explicit approval.

Use `/reference/airlock-security` for the full policy behavior.

## Step 5: verify output

- Confirm created or changed files are inside the selected workspace.
- Confirm generated content matches your request.
- If using Rainy ATM, check execution events in the activity panel.

## Next workflows

- `/features/agent-builder` to create stricter custom agents.
- `/features/neural-panel` to connect cloud operations.
- `/guides/telegram-integration` for remote control by chat.
