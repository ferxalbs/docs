## App does not run after install

- Confirm you installed the correct package for your OS.
- Reopen the app and check whether an update prompt blocks startup.
- If needed, reinstall from the latest release package.

## macOS says app cannot be opened

- Open `System Settings -> Privacy & Security`.
- Find the blocked Rainy MaTE message and click `Open Anyway`.
- Confirm `Open` in the dialog, then start the app again.

## Provider validation fails

- Recheck API key formatting and copied value.
- Confirm network access to your provider endpoint.
- Remove and re-add the key in `Settings -> Models`.

## Agent cannot read or write files

- Verify the intended folder is selected as active workspace.
- Confirm the target path is inside the selected workspace root.
- Re-add the workspace folder if access permissions changed.

## Command blocked by Airlock

- Review command risk level in the approval request.
- Approve only when the action and path are expected.
- Update agent policy if the block is expected behavior.

## Rainy ATM is disconnected

- Open `Rainy ATM` and verify platform key and user API key.
- Confirm the desktop node has network access.
- Reconnect and check that the dashboard shows an active workspace.

## Telegram pairing fails

- Generate a new session code from Rainy ATM.
- Pair quickly because codes are short-lived.
- Confirm you are messaging `@RainyAMTBot`.
