Rainy MaTE is a desktop AI agent platform for workspace automation. It combines a React UI, a Tauri bridge, and a Rust backend with an Airlock approval model.

Use this documentation to install the app, configure providers, and run production workflows with clear approval boundaries.

## Product map

The desktop sidebar is organized into these sections:

- `Agent Chat`: interactive prompt execution inside a selected workspace folder.
- `Rainy ATM`: Cloud Cortex connection, remote pairing, agent fleet, and activity stream.
- `Agent Builder`: create or edit agent specs and deploy to Rainy ATM.
- `Agents Store`: review and edit saved specs, then deploy selected agents.
- `AI Provider`: store and validate provider keys.
- `Appearance`: switch theme and mode.

## Security model

Rainy MaTE uses Airlock levels for tool execution:

- `Level 0 (Safe)`: read-only actions.
- `Level 1 (Sensitive)`: write and navigation actions.
- `Level 2 (Dangerous)`: shell execution and destructive filesystem actions.

The complete mapping is documented in `/features/autonomous-workflows`.
