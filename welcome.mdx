description: Public launch documentation for Rainy MaTE BETA 1.
---

<Warning>
  `Rainy MaTE BETA 1` is currently available for `macOS` only. Windows and Linux support is planned for the near future.
</Warning>

Rainy MaTE is a desktop AI workspace built with React, Tauri, and Rust. These docs are organized by outcome so you can move from setup to reliable production use.

## BETA 1 release notes for users

- This build does not yet include Apple code signing/notarization.
- On first launch, macOS may block app opening until you explicitly allow it in `System Settings`.
- See `/users/install-desktop` for the exact Gatekeeper steps.

## Product naming note

You will still see `rainy-cowork` in repository paths and some internal APIs. That is the original project name. The product evolved and is now published as `Rainy MaTE`.
